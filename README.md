# 👋 Hi, I'm Igor 

Software engineer | frontend-focused full-stack | systems & architecture

## 💡 Who I Am

Engineer since 2014 with roots in frontend and a systems mindset.  
I build maintainable, performant digital products and developer workflows that scale.

**Core interests:** architecture choices, performance, tooling, observability, DX.

## 🧠 What I Do

I don’t just transform Jira tickets into code — I help turn **intent into impact**.

I solve complex problems and translate real-world needs into digital experiences that work reliably at scale.

I think in systems, not features:  
- clarify constraints and trade-offs before designing solutions  
- build products that are predictable, maintainable, and adaptable  
- optimize performance, reliability, and developer feedback loops  
- advocate for accessibility, testability, and clear failure modes

My focus is on **outcomes**, not specific stacks-digitalizing workflows, improving experiences, and shaping how teams and products evolve.

Outside of code, I apply the same mindset to photography, trails, music, and the kitchen: identify patterns, iterate, and refine.
